# Rule-based-Chatbot

The rule-based approach builds rule-based Chatbots which only respond to specific commands and are basic in nature. In a rule-based chatbot the chatbot “flows” are already decided by the chatbot builder and the user is provided with certain set of choices to choose from. Hence it’s very easy to avoid the confusions caused by AI-based chatbots and hence making it highly efficient. 

In this project a Rule based Chatbot is built to provide a seamless response to Data Science interview questions with an appropriate answer.
